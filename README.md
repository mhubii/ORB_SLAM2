# ORB SLAM2 with OctoMap and Obstacle Localization
This is a modified version of Raul Mur-Artal's opensource project [ORB SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2.git "Link to ORB SLAM2 Github"). It extracts an OctoMap from the pointcloud created by ORB SLAM2, and localizes obstacles by segmenting them.

# Build
Follow the instructions from the unmodified implementation [ORB SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2.git "Link to ORB SLAM2 Github"). 

# Thanks to these helpful Sources
Part of the OctopMap implementation is inspired by the great work of Lin Huican: [ORB SLAM2 with OctoMap](https://github.com/LinHuican/ORB_SLAM2_with_OctoMap.git "Link to ORB SLAM2 with OctoMap Github"). Also thanks to the [doxygen documentation](http://code.luohuiwu.cc/annotated.html "Link to Doxygen Documentation") of ORB SLAM2.
